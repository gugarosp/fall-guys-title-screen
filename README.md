# Fall Guys Title Screen
Fall Guys is a platform battle royale video game made by the developer Mediatonic. This project is a browser version of the game's title screen.

## How to run
Just clone this repository or download the files and open the `index.html` file in the browser.

## Note
Some elements may not appear depending on the screen dimensions. This could be easily solved, however I decided to maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio of the game.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
