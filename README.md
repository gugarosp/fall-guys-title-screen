## Version refrence
This project was started based on the Shapes and Stickers update and ended on the Survival update from Creative Construction season.

## Note
Some elements may not appear depending on the screen dimensions. This could be easily solved, however I decided to maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio of the game.
